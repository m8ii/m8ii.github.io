Despite the ever-present challenges of drugs, gangs, and trouble, Ali manages to steer clear. Doris emphasizes the importance of education, viewing it as a gateway to opportunities. She works tirelessly at two jobs, determined to prevent her children from following their father's troubled path. Jazz is exceptionally bright for her age, and Ali takes immense pride in her. Their bond is strong, and Ali recognizes its value.</p>

                        <p>Getting to know the characters in <i>When I Was The Greatest</i> was a true pleasure. Ali tells
                            his story direct to the reader, personalising it even more as we learn how he met the
                            brothers next door. The contrast between Ali and his best friend Needles is obvious and
                            often uneasy, but the care that Aliâs mum has for the neglected boys is heartening, smoothing
                            sharpening edges.</p>

                        <p>When things go terribly wrong, even Ali believes there is only one way out â violence. The
                            actual solution is unexpected â by Ali and myself, and pure heart. Maybe it can be the
                            solution to other things in his life too.</p>

                        <p>Many scenes are brought to life for the reader by illustrator Akhran Girmay, with emotion

                        <p>A credible, convincing, coming of age story. I felt I was right there with the characters,
                            living life in Brooklyn New York. I loved Ali and his family to bits!</p>

                        <p>Ali loves his neighbourhood in Brooklyn New York. Living with his 11 yr old sister Jazz and their no nonsense mum Doris, life is pretty good. Despite drugs, gangs and trouble never far away, he keeps away from all that stuff.
                            Doris is strict about their education, drumming it into her children that school is a way to choices. She works two jobs since their dad left â and she doesnât want them following his path into trouble he couldnât get out of. Jazz is smart for an 11 yr old and Ali is proud of his sister. Theyâre close and he soon realises how precious their bond really is.</p>
